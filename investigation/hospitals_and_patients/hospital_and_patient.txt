Are average scores for hospital quality or procedural variability correlated with patient survey responses?

There is a weak negative correlation between the variance of the score and the average Hospital Dimension Score in survey response.
I run 8 different of correlations here:

1 Correlation between the average score of the hospital and the average overall ratings in survey response, the result is -0.038
2 Correlation between the variance of the hospital score and the average overall ratings in survey response, the result is -0.096
3 Correlation between the average score of the hospital and the average Hospital Achievement Points in survey response, the result is -0.028
4 Correlation between the variance of the hospital score and the average Hospital Achievement Points in survey response, the result is -0.066
5 Correlation between the average score of the hospital and the average Hospital Improvement Points in survey response, the result is -0.028
6 Correlation between the variance of the hospital score and the average Hospital Improvement Points in survey response, the result is -0.063
7 Correlation between the average score of the hospital and the average Hospital Dimension Score in survey response , the result is -0.029
8 Correlation between the variance of the hospital score and the average Hospital Dimension Score in survey response , the result is -0.114

All of the the first 7 items have a very low correlation score, which indicates there is a poor or hardly correlation between the hospital quality or procedural variabilty between these patient survey responses. Only the 8th item has a high correlationL -0.114. That means when the variance of the procedures score increaase, the average hospital dimension score in survey response decreased. The possible reason could be that if a procedure are of very high quality in some hospitals but are of poor quality in other hospitals, patients can feel the big different and therefore are morely likely to report their dissatfaction in the survey reponse. However, we may need more data to validate the assumption.
